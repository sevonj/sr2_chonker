The JSON counterparts of the structs are intended to be serialized and deserialized into/from JSON
(you don't say). JSON files are used by the editor and converted to binary and repacked on export.

Structure of these should the same as the normal type, with exception that instead of using "num_x"
and delivering the "x" block separately, any obvious child data is nested into its parent.
Uninitialized runtime only fields are also stripped.
